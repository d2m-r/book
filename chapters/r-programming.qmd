### Indexing and subsetting with [ ] & $

### (more base R essentials)

## Functions in R {#sec-programming-functions}

We introduced functions in @sec-function-basics, and you'll have seen them used throughout course materials so far.
There's just no sensible way to talk about anything in R without implicitly using some functions, so hopefully by now you've picked up on the gist of how they work.
You can honestly get pretty just using functions without understanding them, but obviously you can get a lot farther if you do, so let's talk about them a bit more.

Here's a thing that is definitely totally hypothetical and has never happened:

> I ignore my work and start playing my favorite video game.

"Ignoring" and "playing" are functions, and "my work" and "my favorite video game" are the objects those functions are acting on.

### Function arguments and return values

When you want to do the action (or more analogous to R, when you want to tell someone to do the action), you'll often want to add some more information to specify what exactly you want to do the action to or how to do it.
