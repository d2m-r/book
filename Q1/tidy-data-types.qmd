# Dates and times with lubridate 
<!-- I don't use lubridate much and it wasn't in the original d2mr, so this is just a possible list of things to cover suggested by copilot -->

## Overview

### What are dates and times?

### Why do we need a whole package for them?

### Base R can do date and time stuff, but it's not great

#### as.POSIXct

#### as.POSIXlt

#### strptime

## lubridate functions

### Parsing dates and times

#### ymd, mdy, dmy, ymd_hms, etc.

#### parse_date_time

### Extracting components

#### year, month, day, hour, minute, second

#### wday, yday, mday

### Manipulating dates and times

#### %m+% and %m-% for adding and subtracting time

#### interval and duration

#### floor_date, ceiling_date, round_date

### Formatting dates and times

#### format

#### strftime
